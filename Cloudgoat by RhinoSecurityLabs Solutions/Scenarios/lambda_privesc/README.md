Starting as the IAM user Chris, the attacker discovers that they can assume a role that has full Lambda access and pass role permissions. The attacker can then perform privilege escalation to obtain full admin access.

Inline Policies:
- This lists the Inline policies that is attached to the user. 
- Inline policies are policies that are directly attached to an IAM user, group, or role.
- It is a strict one-to-one relationship between the policy and identity.
- They are deleted when you delete the identity.

Enumerate Inline policies:

```
aws iam list-user-policies --user-name USERNAME
```

Managed Policies:
- There are two types of Managed Policies:
	1) AWS Managed Policy
       - It is created and administered by AWS.
       - It is a standalone policy means that the policy has its own `ARN` that includes the policy name.
       - For example, `arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/IAMReadOnlyAccess`Â is an AWS managed policy.    
	2) Customer Managed Policies
       - These are policies that are customly designed by the user.   
  
Enumerating Managed policies:

```
aws iam list-attached-user-policies --user-name USERNAME
```

Lets analyze the permissions associated with the cg-lambdamanager role to see what can be gained by assuming it. Run the following to enumerate the cg-lambdamangers permissions.

```
aws iam list-attached-role-policies --role-name ROLE-NAME 
```
